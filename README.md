# frontend-exercises
Just a place to test out Frontend Code. 
I use ChatGPT to generate coding challenges of various levels. It has been an unexpectedly useful assistant in creating challenges to test specific skills. 
Feel free to have a look into the types of exercises I've implemented.
I use this primarily to challenge myself and increase my knowledge one bite-sized tailored exercise at a time.
